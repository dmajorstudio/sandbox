# Sandbox
Repository for displaying examples of the work I do.
I have been struggling with displaying any of my more technical work with the world, and believe this to be a good spot to start generating code in the public eye. - Also a good spot where I can store code I use from time to time.

Primarily in Python for Maya (2016).
- RnD work
- Tests
- Tutorials
- Messing about with GUIs

I've been working with the maya.cmds module for the past couple years, these days I'm starting to transition some of that knowledge into PyMEL and so far I am enjoying it. Occasionally I'll come across things that break and don't function entirely as anticipated.

CC welcome
